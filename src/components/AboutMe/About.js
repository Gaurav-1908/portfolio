                Hey! I am Gaurav Gadkari. 
                I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in computer Enginnering from 
                AISSMS College Of Ingineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like to build projects using Python-django. 
                I explored how to code myself, fast-forward to today, 
                I do programming in various languages and can use various technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm interested in building something awesome with code and automate tasks with code, 
                currently focused on Web & Mobile Development, Open Source and Competitive Programming
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding I hangout with my friends, watch some show on Netflix, 
                or if the weather's good, play football!
            </p>
